## Alex's Website Portfolio

### Project Goal 
This website aims to portray previous projects that I have completed in order to illustrate my work as good as possible. You can also find a brief TMAY along with some of my skills. 
### Technologies used
- The website primarily incorporates HTML and CSS in order to display the contents and styling in the best light possible.
- JavaScript was also used in order to improve the functionality of the navigation bar. The navigation bar transforms into an X once it is closed by an EventListener created in Js.
